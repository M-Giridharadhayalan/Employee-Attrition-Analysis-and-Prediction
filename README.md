# Employee-Attrition-Analysis-and-Prediction
This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict employee attrition and assess job satisfaction levels. By analyzing HR data, it applies four key models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Linear Regression—to extract meaningful insights about workforce behavior. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models are employed to classify employees as likely to stay or leave based on factors such as overtime, job role, and work-life balance. Meanwhile, Linear Regression is used to estimate an employee’s job satisfaction score as a continuous value influenced by metrics like monthly income, performance rating, and relationship with management. Together, these models provide a comprehensive approach to identifying attrition risks and understanding what drives employee satisfaction, enabling HR teams to make proactive, data-driven decisions to improve retention and workplace engagement.
